# ElectronicVotingMachine
I made this EVM software on assembly language on Mars
In this software people can vote to there desired candidates. The software also counts the vote and also restricts people after voting once. The software also inputs user ID card number before letting anyone vote. The voting is done area wise according to the users UC number
